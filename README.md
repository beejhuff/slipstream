## Be Warned!

**Contracts are prescription-strength legal devices.  If you need terms for your product or service, don't be an idiot.  Hire a lawyer.  A good one will ask good questions.  There's no harm in telling them about this form.  They may decide it fits your needs.**

**Do _not_ put confidential information about you, your product, or your customers in issues or pull requests.  Do _not_ ask for legal advice on GitHub, or try to disguise requests for legal advice as general questions or hypotheticals.  Nobody dumb enough to fall for that will be a good source of advice.**

## Goals

This form is for small companies offering software services that users access via web browser.  It was written from scratch with a few key goals in mind:

1.  _Minimum Legalese_:  Wherever possible, the form tries to use simple sentences of ordinary English.

2.  _Maximum Internet_:  As much communication, from signup to changes through termination, should happen online as possible.

3.  _Commercial Flexibility_:  Allow providers to offer custom packages of features, pricing, deal terms, and other details without revising the form.

4.  _One Form to Rule Them All_:  Free and paid customers, hosted-service and licensed, should all see one set of legal terms.

5.  _Balance_:  Try to plot a middle course between what providers want and what customers want, placing risks and responsibilities where they'd usually end up if each side had full opportunity to put all its best arguments forward.
