## Be Warned!

**Contracts are prescription-strength legal devices.  If you need terms for your product or service, don't be an idiot.  Hire a lawyer.  A good one will ask good questions, and find out whether a form like this one fits your needs.**

**Do _not_ put confidential information about you, your product, or your customers in issues or pull requests.  Do _not_ ask for legal advice on GitHub, or try to disguise requests for legal advice as general questions or "hypothetical".  Nobody dumb enough to fall for that is a good source of legal advice.**
